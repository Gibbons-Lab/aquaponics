We noticed also that the plant trays were labelled twice, each one labelled both tray 1 and tray 2. We removed one of the labels so there would be no confusion in the future, but it is possible that all previous measurements could be for either plant tray.

When replacing the aerator tube for the tank, one of the glasscovers fell into the tank. We had to retrieve the air stone form the grow bed with a net, but not for the tank because it was still attatched to the tubing. The fish were initailly very sluggish and barely moving, but after air flow was restored they began to move again, in fact becoing very agitated after feeding. One fish especially was swimming all around the tank, and then after a few minutes ate all or almost all of the food.
